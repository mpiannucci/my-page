		<h2>SimpleSolver</h2>
		<p>As an engineering student, it has frustrated me that were no quadratic equation solving applications with an elegant user interface. I strived to create a simple, but useful app with a user interface that matched these characteristics. Thus, SimpleSolver for Android was born. This application is now available on Google Play for free.</p>
