		<p class="links">Viewing the surf camera for Narragansett, RI has always proved to be tedious on a phone, especially Android. I started a project to make viewing the surf camera out of conviencence. Now I have made it into a fully featured application. The app shows the live HD stream straight from the beach. It also shows forecast info from both <a href="http://magicseaweed.com">MagicSeaweed</a> and <a href="http://swellinfo.com">SwellInfo</a>. Last, it displays tide information from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/?apiref=b80661e4fc362f50">Wunderground</a>.</p>
		<p class="links">It is available on Google Play now! Future features include realtime buoy data and animated swell and wind charts. I have also started to develop an accompanying iOS app. Finally, feel free to check out the source on my <a href="https://github.com/mpiannucci/HackWinds">Github</a>. Pray for waves!</p>

		<h2 id="simpleSolverTitle">SimpleSolver</h2>
		<p>As an engineering student, it has frustrated me that were no quadratic equation solving applications with an elegant user interface. I strived to create a simple, but useful app with a user interface that matched these characteristics. Thus, SimpleSolver for Android was born. This application is now available on Google Play for free.</p>
