            <h1 class="welcomeMessage">Hello, I'm Matt</h1>

            <p>I am an Engineer from Rhode Island with a Bachelor's of Science in Ocean Engineering from the University of Rhode Island. Growing up in Rhode Island, I was drawn to the ocean. While my heart still lives with the sea, my interests shifted in college, driving me towards electronics and software development. I have forged my own path by layering software development talent on top of traditional engineering principles.</p>

            <p>I have worked on a variety of projects including autonomous robotic boats, embedded wireless bridge health monitoring systems, mobile apps, and Naval Ship design software.</p>

            <p>My favorite hobbies include surfing and skiing. There's nothing like 35 degree water to wake up the brain!</p>
